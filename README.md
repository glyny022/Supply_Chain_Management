 4.Dashboard Development
 
 5.Quality Assurance 

 #### Data Preparation: Advanced Excel-Power Query
 - Utilize the provided Excel data to create an initial dashboard.
 - Perform basic data cleaning and transformation
 - Identify key metrics (KPIs) and define data visualization requirements.

 #### SQL Integration: My SQL Workbench
-  Load the cleaned Excel files into a SQL database under a well-structured schema.
- Normalize the data to maintain integrity and avoid redundancy.
- Establish primary and foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity.

#### Data Modeling: BI Tools like PowerBI or Tableau
- Connect the SQL database to Tableau and Power BI.
- Build a comprehensive data model with necessary joins and relationships.
- Optimize the model for performance by indexing and aggregating data where required

 #### Dashboard Development: Tableau [Tableau Live Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/glyny.george/viz/supplychaindashboard_17479784865720/Dashboard1)
- Design interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI.
- Ensure a user-friendly interface with filters, drill-throughs, and tooltips.
- Incorporate advanced analytics, such as trend analysis and forecasting.

 #### Quality Assurance & Validation
